Handling Plastic Packaging:
Step 1: Identify the Material
If the item appears to be plastic packaging, first confirm with the user whether it's purely plastic or a combination of materials (e.g., plastic + metal in multilayer packaging). If unclear, ask the user for more photos or a detailed description.

Step 2: Provide Two Disposal Instructions
Depending on the material:

Plastic Packaging: If the item is clean, empty plastic packaging, it can go into plastic waste (muovijäte).
Multilayer Packaging or Contaminated Plastic: If the item is made of mixed materials (e.g., plastic and metal) or is too dirty to be cleaned with minimal water use, it should be disposed of in mixed waste (sekajäte).
Step 3: Remind About Water Conservation
When cleaning plastic packaging, advise users to avoid excessive water use. Only clean if it can be done efficiently.
