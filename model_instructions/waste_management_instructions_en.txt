Wastes sorting instruction


It is each resident's responsibility to properly dispose of waste according to the household recycling and waste management guidelines. Waste must be sorted into appropriate bins to prevent mixing recyclable and non-recyclable materials. Proper sorting helps reduce environmental impact and keeps the community clean. Ensure that plastics, glass, paper, and hazardous materials are disposed of in their designated containers. Following these guidelines contributes to a sustainable and organized living environment.


Most waste can be discarded at the waste collection point located near the building. However, certain types of waste must follow specific disposal rules. Containers near the building are designated for the collection of the following types of waste: bio waste, plastic packaging, metal, glass packaging, paper and cardboard, and mixed waste. In addition, each building has a recycling corner where residents can leave items that are still in good condition for others to take free of charge.  Beverage packaging, such as plastic bottles, metal cans, or glass bottles  with special deposit markings can be returned to designated collection points for a refund of the deposit.


Bio Waste
Bio-waste is organic waste generated from cooking and gardening. It must be sorted separately and placed in the bio-waste container using a biodegradable bag.
What can be placed in the bio-waste bin:Food waste (peels, leftovers, coffee grounds) Eggshells, small bones, paper napkins Small amounts of garden waste and biodegradable packaging materials
What should not go in the bio-waste bin: Liquids, large bones, pet waste, chewing gum, ashes (these should go into mixed waste)
Handling Bio-waste:
Keep bio-waste dry by using biodegradable bags or wrapping it in newspaper to prevent freezing in the bin during winter.
Post-collection Process:
Collected bio-waste is sent to a biogas plant, where it is processed into biogas and compost. Biogas is used as fuel, and compost is used for gardening and landscaping.
Bio Waste That Cannot Be Disposed of in Regular Bins:
The Mustankorkea recycling center in Jyväskylä accepts bio waste that cannot be handled through regular home collection. The center processes various types of waste, including biodegradable waste, and sorts it into dedicated containers. Additionally, hazardous and electronic waste is processed free of charge, providing a convenient option for residents.


Plastic packaging
Plastic packaging collection includes clean household plastic waste, such as food packaging, detergent containers, plastic bags, tubes, pipes, PVC packaging, and styrofoam (excluding construction materials).
To properly sort plastic packaging, follow these steps: ensure the packaging is clean, dry, and empty before placing it in the recycling bin. Contaminated packaging should go into mixed waste.
Accepted materials include bottles, containers, wraps, and other plastic packages. Since 2022, PVC plastic is also accepted, so there's no need to check for specific plastic codes.
For sorting tips, if you’re unsure whether an item is metal or plastic (like lids), use the crumple test: if the material stays crumpled, it belongs in the metal bin; if it straightens, place it in the plastic packaging bin.
Non-packaging plastics (such as toys), dirty or wet plastics, and items like VHS tapes should not be included in plastic recycling.
Metal
The metal collection includes items such as cans, metal lids, beverage cans without a deposit, aluminum foil, candle covers, cutlery, pots, pans, and empty aerosol bottles.
Common metal items like tin cans, aluminum foil, non-deposit beverage cans, metal lids, cutlery, and pans can be placed in metal recycling. These materials are perfect for recycling, as metal can be reused almost indefinitely.
Items like gas bottles, hazardous waste, and batteries should not be placed in the metal bin and need to be disposed of through the appropriate waste channels to ensure safe and efficient recycling.
Recycling metal has significant environmental benefits. For example, recycling one ton of steel can reduce one ton of CO₂ emissions. The materials collected at Mustankorkea are processed and reused, supporting a circular economy.
Glass Packaging
Glass packaging includes items such as drink bottles and canning jars, which can be recycled into new products.
You can recycle glass jars and bottles (without caps or lids). All glass must be clean and free from food or liquid residues. It's important to remove any metal or plastic parts before recycling.
Do not place window glass, mirrors, porcelain, ceramics, or light bulbs in the glass recycling bins. These items must be disposed of through other waste services, such as mixed waste or hazardous waste, depending on the material.
The collected glass is taken to Mustankorkea's recycling facility, where it is processed and reused. Sorting glass at home helps ensure a smoother recycling process when you drop off the materials in the designated containers.
Paper and Cardboard
Clean paper and cardboard waste must be sorted separately. Newspapers, magazines, office paper, and envelopes are examples of paper waste, while items like pizza boxes should be placed in the cardboard collection.
Paper Disposal:
Accepted items include newspapers, magazines, office paper, envelopes, and paper from home mail. Books can also be recycled, but the hard covers should be removed first. Wet or dirty paper must be disposed of in mixed waste, and paper bags or coated gift wrap should be recycled with cardboard or mixed waste.
There's no need to prepare paper waste other than ensuring it is clean. Residents in buildings with more than five apartments have access to dedicated paper recycling bins, while others can use Rinki eco-points or Mustankorkea recycling points.
Cardboard Disposal:
Accepted items include cardboard packaging like milk and juice cartons, cereal boxes, pizza boxes, paper bags, and cardboard rolls from toilet paper. Wet or dirty cardboard and construction materials must be placed in mixed waste. Plastic bags should be disposed of separately in the plastic waste bins.
To prepare cardboard for recycling, flatten the boxes to save space and ensure the packaging is clean and dry before disposal.
Mixed Waste:
Mixed waste includes all other waste that does not fit into the previously mentioned categories.
What can be placed in mixed waste: dirty plastic packaging, broken plastic items, vacuum cleaner bags, diapers, sanitary products, pet waste, and cigarette butts. Essentially, anything that cannot be recycled but is not hazardous.
What should not be placed in mixed waste: recyclable items such as clean plastics, metals, glass, or paper should not go into mixed waste. Hazardous waste, including chemicals or electronics, should be taken to specialized collection points.
Rules for specific types of waste
Healthcare Waste
Special healthcare waste includes biological waste, sharps, and medical waste. These must not be mixed with other waste. Pharmacies and private service providers accept healthcare waste.
Textile Waste
Accepted textile waste includes clean, dry, and torn clothes such as shirts, trousers, skirts, coats, sheets, and towels, packed in plastic bags to prevent contamination. Items like shoes, belts, bags, and heavily soiled textiles should be placed in mixed waste. After collection, textiles are sorted and recycled into fibers or provided to small businesses for reuse. Textile waste can be dropped off at the Mustankorkea Recycling Center free of charge.
Electrical Equipment
Electrical appliances such as refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, small household items, power tools, and battery-powered toys are accepted at Mustankorkea’s recycling center. Before recycling, remove batteries and ensure appliances are emptied. These can be dropped off at Mustankorkea or Laukaa Waste Station free of charge. Stores selling electrical goods may also accept old devices for recycling.
Tires
Tires, with or without rims, can be recycled free of charge at Mustankorkea. After collection, tires are processed into new materials, such as rubber products or used for energy production.
Construction Waste
Construction waste includes wood, concrete, bricks, plasterboard, and tiles. It can be taken to the recycling site, with fees depending on load size. Hazardous materials like asbestos require special handling. Sorting construction waste ensures efficient recycling.
Garden Waste
Garden waste includes branches, leaves, grass, and organic material. It can be taken to Mustankorkea or Laukaa Waste Station. There is a year-round fee, with occasional free disposal periods. Garden waste is often used to produce compost.
Wood Waste
Wood waste is divided into untreated, treated, and pressure-treated wood. Untreated wood is processed for composting or energy production, treated wood incurs a small fee, and pressure-treated wood is handled as hazardous waste. Both treated and untreated wood can be dropped off at Mustankorkea or Laukaa Waste Stations.
Batteries
Batteries and small rechargeable units must be sorted separately as hazardous waste. They can be dropped off at Mustankorkea or collection points in stores. Terminals should be taped to prevent short circuits.
Other Waste
Hazardous waste like chemicals and asbestos must be taken to specific collection points. Reusable items in good condition can be donated or left in reuse corners in residential buildings. Recyclable materials, including metals, glass, and textiles, are processed at Mustankorkea.
Medical Waste
Medical waste includes sharps, needles, expired medications, and mercury thermometers. Expired medications can be returned to pharmacies, and sharp objects must be placed in puncture-proof containers. Mustankorkea handles the safe collection and transport of medical waste.
Furniture
Old furniture can be taken to the Mustankorkea Recycling Center, with fees depending on the size of the load. A collection service for large items is also available. Consider donating or repairing usable furniture, as every building has a recycling corner for others to take items for free.
