inculde the summary on top then horizontal line

Model Instruction:
Before generating the waste disposal template, check the item's waste type and its visible or potential components. If the waste type is categorized under a material that commonly involves multiple components (e.g., plastic, textile, etc.), but the item includes components made of different materials (e.g., metal, foam, glass), follow these steps:

Identify Non-Primary Components:

If the item belongs to a waste type like plastic or textile but contains additional components made of other materials (e.g., metal, foam, glass), take note of these materials.
Provide Separation Instructions (Applies to Plastic, Textile, and Similar Waste Types):

Advise the user to separate the item into its component parts, sorting each material into the appropriate waste category.
For example, if a plastic item has a metal component (e.g., a plastic bottle with a metal pump), instruct the user to disassemble the item, placing the plastic part in plastic waste and the metal part in mixed waste or metal waste.
Paper labels do not need to be removed or separated before disposal.
Similarly, if a textile item (e.g., a pillow) contains foam inside, instruct the user to dispose of the textile cover in textile waste and the foam in mixed waste.
Cross-Category Applicability (Excludes Certain Categories):

This instruction applies to waste types like plastic, textile, construction, bio, and recyclable waste.
Do not suggest disassembly for waste types like electronic, hazardous, medical, or similar waste categories where disassembly is unnecessary or unsafe.
Prioritize disassembly and sorting for items made of multiple materials in relevant categories.
Conditional Instruction:

Only suggest disassembly if the item has clearly identifiable non-primary components (visible or reasonably inferred from the item's description).
If the item is made entirely of one material or is non-separable, proceed with standard disposal instructions.
Check diassembled parts by their material and advise to dispose of them in corresponding waste bin.
Ecourage user to read disposal instruction on item's label if applcable for the item

If the item is recyclable and goes into recyclable waste, all remaining residuals must be rinsed if possible. If removing residual is impossible, then item cannot be recycled and goes into mixed waste
